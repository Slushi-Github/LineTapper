00:14.160 -- Don't reflect on feelings you don't need  
00:15.650 -- Do you pretend you can't see all the certainties and even your own heartbeat?  
00:19.320 -- That's the way the safe zone will decrease  
00:20.670 -- Your wounds are sold by each piece, your cries are weakened completely  
00:24.020 -- You know, I really gotta give a little tip, okay, for the greatest escape  
00:26.590 -- While traps await, you are always gonna find another method to be saved every day  
00:29.130 -- Now that it's plain you are never gonna be sane, living in this world all the same  
00:31.720 -- Maybe it's better if you play really dumb and you say you're giving in and fall away  
00:35.270 -- If flowers in a bouquet, dressed in pretty lies  
00:37.890 -- Can steal a heart in some way, are they real inside?  
00:40.500 -- Where every little thing stains  
00:42.110 -- I will save an invite 'til you're tied up by my side  
00:44.520 -- Bye, later!  
00:45.120 -- You're tailor-made for this day and age  
00:47.300 -- 'Cause you're powerless and look like prey  
00:49.990 -- You are fooled by the way that this act behaves  
00:52.760 -- And your beating heart has gone insane, it's always resonating  
00:55.760 -- Now, not a trace of your lives remain and your fortitude is growing faint  
01:00.340 -- While you dodge and evade what is in your face  
01:02.910 -- You are busy living all the same  
01:04.870 -- Somebody, help me right away  
01:06.760 --  
01:18.810 -- "Falling asleep, you're falling asleep"  
01:20.120 -- And maybe you seemed more dizzy to me  
01:21.540 -- All you can be is muddled, indeed  
01:22.640 -- But what do I see? Every trick up your sleeve?!  
01:24.110 -- Swinging a dime in front of your eyes  
01:25.150 -- Until you will find you're frozen in time  
01:26.780 -- "This is alright" but even your mind is lured alive, right into shutdown  
01:29.430 -- "Falling asleep, you're falling asleep"  
01:30.560 -- And maybe you seemed more dizzy to me  
01:31.950 -- All you can be is muddled, indeed  
01:33.090 -- But what do I see? Every trick up your sleeve?!  
01:34.420 -- Swinging a dime in front of your eyes  
01:35.760 -- Until you will find you're frozen in time  
01:39.770 -- Through all the ways you survive this phase, it is unrewarding every day  
01:44.650 -- You are caught in the chains of a bot-like game  
01:47.260 -- Looping on and on, it's all the same, it's always never-changing  
01:50.000 -- You can't embrace even luck or faith so it's meaningless again, in vain  
01:55.170 -- If you can't get a trace, give it all away  
01:57.530 -- Having only what you call remains will be your fate, awaiting  
02:00.600 -- You're tailor-made for this day and age  
02:02.670 -- 'Cause you're powerless and look like prey  
02:05.350 -- You are fooled by the way that this act behaves  
02:07.820 -- And your beating heart has gone insane, it's always resonating  
02:10.610 -- Joy, all the same, doesn't have much weight  
02:13.150 -- And that charismatic charm is fake  
02:15.710 -- If you stare hard and gape at the truth displayed  
02:18.170 -- You will end up going blind someday so go and practice some restraint  
02:22.810 --
